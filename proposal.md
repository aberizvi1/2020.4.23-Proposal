# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Donor demographics


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Taking inputs like name, email, and state, I will identify how popular those names, email addresses, and states are in a long list of donors.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My software will take the input of name, email, and state.
In Python, it will then identify some statistics about that name from the list (i.e. how often the name appears in the list, and the respective state).
The same will then be done for the email address. I.e. if the person has a gmail email, then it will identify how many people have a gmail with that name, and in that state and in general.
Further, after the state input is taken, the statistics will be printed about that state i.e. how often that state appears in the list, and how often it appears with that name, and that email address.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
NA


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
NA


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome would be to print how many times that name, email address, and state are found in the list.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A better outcome would be to print:
-how many times the input name, email address, and state are found in the list.
-how many times the input name is found within the input email address and state.
-how many times the input email address is found in the input state.
-how many times the input state is found in general, with that name and/or email


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome would be to print:
-how many times the input name, email address, and state are found in the list (with percentages out of the list as a whole).
-how many times the input name is found within the input email address and state (with percentages out of the list of names as a whole).
-how many times the input email address is found in the input state (with percentages out of the list of emails as a whole).
-how many times the input state is found in general, with that name and/or email (with percentages out of the list of states as a whole).


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to acquire the skill of identifying inputs in a CSV as well as calculating statistics on said inputs.
I will need to research specific tools to use in Python that will help me count and calculate statistics based on inputs whether that implies using new 'import' functions and beyond.
